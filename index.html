        <h1><b>Lyrics</b></h1>
        <p>Such a shame, it’s wasted on the youth<br \>
        Let’s call the spade a spade<br \>
        When we pay for all the things, the things we do<br \>
        Ooh yeah, life is a game until it hits you in the face<br \>
        Such a shame, it’s wasted on the…
        </p>
        <p>You know I would hate to say “told you so.”<br \>
        Forget your inhibitions, ready for the fall<br \>
        The word on the wire, you’re living in denial<br \>
        And you’re putting out the fire,<br \>
        and you’re letting go of your desires
        </p>
        <p>So kill it before it determines who you’re gonna be today<br \>
        Let all you think can’t be give way to possibility, you’ll see<br \>
        You’re staring down the barrel of the permanence of truth<br \>
        You’re giving in to every fear and I know what it’s doing to you<br \>
        </p>
        <p>King Procrastination waits his life away<br \>
        In hopes someone will show him the path that he should take<br \>
        Stay weary of the hopeless in hopes that you may find a better way to fly<br \>
        Ooh yeah, life is a game until it hits you in the face<br \>
        Such a shame, it's wasted on the...<br \>
        </p>
        <p>You know I would hate to say “told you so.”<br \>
        Forget your inhibitions, ready for the fall<br \>
        The word on the wire, you’re living in denial<br \>
        And you’re putting out the fire,<br \>
        and you’re letting go of your desires
        </p>
        <p>So kill it before it determines who you’re gonna be today<br \>
        Let all you think can’t be give way to possibility, you’ll see<br \>
        You’re staring down the barrel of the permanence of truth<br \>
        You’re giving in to every fear and I know what it’s doing,<br \>
        I know what it's doing!<br \>
        </p>
        <p>They’re clearing a path<br \>
        Don’t let 'em burn in your kitchen<br \>
        Domino, now you know they’re clearing a path<br \>
        And they’re burning your kitchen<br \>
        </p>
        <p>[Instrumental]<br \>
        </p>
        <p>Step at a time, know that you’re mine, not to borrow<br \>
        So tell me why you’re running away, don’t you worry<br \>
        Step at a time, know that you’ll find, there’s no sorrow<br \>
        In places where your heart has a say<br \>
        Do what you want and don’t let them see you run<br \>
        Blood on the radio, there’s blood on the radio<br \>
        </p>
        <p>[Bitchin' Guitar Solo]<br \>
        </p>
        <p>So kill it before it determines who you’re gonna be today<br \>
        Let all you think can’t be give way to possibility, you’ll see<br \>
        You’re staring down the barrel of the permanence of truth<br \>
        You’re giving in to every fear and I know what it’s doing,<br \>
        I know what it's doing!<br \>
